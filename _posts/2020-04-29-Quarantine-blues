Quarentine is a very weird period, not a lot of interesting things are 
going on, except obviously the pandemic.

My day has been mostly been staring at screens and into the void. Also 
my sleep schedule has been quite a disaster. Went 3 days with about 
10hrs sleep, but its quite okay now(as of today). There were a few 
personal things that did happen in this month that needed quite some 
time to clear out, and has kept me a little busy.
